    <h1>6 weeks at the Recurse Center</h1>

<p>I just finished attending a 6 week half-batch of the Recurse Center (RC), and partaking in a reflective RC tradition, this is my Return Statement.</p>

<p>What&#39;s RC? It&#39;s self described as a writers retreat, but for programmers. It&#39;s this big room in downtown Manhattan where roughly 60 people show up every day and sit around and program and talk about programming.</p>

<p>Looking back a few weeks later: I&#39;m glad I did RC. If you&#39;ve found this post because you&#39;re thinking of applying, then <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">please do</a>!</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Updated Jun 2017 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Looking back a year after my batch, I have nothing but nice things to say about RC. It&#39;s a great community.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<h2>What I did for six weeks</h2>

<p>I spent six weeks honing my Haskell skills. I fixed a tiny bug in GHC, I implemented some functional data structures, I gave a presentation on Quickcheck, I looked a little into language extensions. I also collaborated with a lot of people on a lot of very different things- from Elm, to C, to OCaml, to Rust, one hour curiosities to multi-day adventures.</p>

<p>I spent the first couple weeks looking at functional (persistent) data structures with <a href="https://phasedchirp.github.io/">Sean Martin</a>. We <a href="https://github.com/anniecherk/functional-data-structures-experiments">implemented</a> functional queues, priority queues implemented with skew heaps, and finger trees.</p>

<p>I also paired with <a href="https://github.com/lamarqua">Adrien Lamarque</a> on a fabulously silly project we called <a href="https://github.com/lamarqua/hasquelle">La Hasquelle</a> which is a find-and-replace haskell keyword translator. Why would you want this? So you can live code in other languages! Bonjour monde!</p>

<p>I briefly looked into Elm by pairing with <a href="https://github.com/jjst">Jérémie Jost</a> on an <a href="https://github.com/jjst/elmtimate-tictactoe">Elm-timate tic-tac-toe</a> game he was working on. I also participated in weekly &quot;code dojos&quot; where we would take an hour to pair program something like a hackerrank problem, mostly working with <a href="https://github.com/mariellefoster">Marielle Foster</a>. That was awesome to practice algorithms, see lots of other different ways to solve the same problem- and see some really cool visualizations! I spent one morning learning enough OCaml to do a problem.</p>

<p>My big &quot;what I did with my summer break essay&quot; project I did at RC was I <a href="http://anniecherkaev.com/projects/contributing-to-ghc">contributed to GHC</a>.</p>

<p>I spent the last couple days of my batch making a website... after watching a few long videos on css and php.</p>

<p>After spending six weeks coming in every day and programming whatever I thought was interesting, I came to to comfortable conclusion, that yes, I really did in fact like programming. I didn&#39;t end up here by accident, I ended up here by choice.</p>

<h2>Post-batch</h2>

<p>One really unexpected and wonderful thing about RC is that after your batch you can stay connected on a big internal forum- and this forum is completely full of: interesting very technical conversations, people who can help you out if you&#39;re stuck with a bug or need a recommendation for some tools, and links to interesting articles, written by recursers and beyond. I can pretty frequently say that the most interesting thing that I learned in a given day was from a link I found through RC.</p>

<p>Post-batch, I&#39;m excited to be participating as a mentor in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers">RCStart</a>.</p>

<p>And lastly, because I can&#39;t help myself, here are a few of the things I loved the most about New York this summer:</p>

<h2>When in NYC</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Roerich museum is superb, and also free!</li>
<li>Cafe Mogador has unsurpassed Moroccan food!</li>
<li>Washington Square park and Central Park both are delightful</li>
<li>The Union Square Greenmarket was wild. What a market!</li>
<li>Dumbo boulders is an outdoor bouldering gym directly under the Manhattan bridge. Cheap, too!</li>
<li>Manhattan community boathouse has free kayak rentals! That was great on a bluebird hundred degree day.</li>
<li>The highline is always delightful.</li>
</ul>

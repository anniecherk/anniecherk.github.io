### Hello World

<p></p>

I'm a software engineer broadly interested in systems. In the past I've also spent time thinking about security, programming langauges and machine learning.

I'll be looking for a âœ¨new jobâœ¨ in early 2022. I'm interested in working on a large production system at scale, or a system in the process of scaling up. If you know of teams that might be a good fit, I'd love to hear from you :)

Until recently, I worked as a software engineer at [Galois](https://galois.com). At Galois I primarily worked on [MATE](https://galois.com/project/mate/), a program analysis platform for helping developers find security vulnerabilities in their programs.

Before Galois, I dropped out of the PhD program in Computer Science from the University Utah, where I was advised by [Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/). I designed and implemented [SweetPea](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01598-2), a programming language which addresses problems of correctness and replicability of pyschology experiments, in collaboration with [Matthew Flatt](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/), [Jonathan Cohen](https://webapps.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/JDC/Home_Page.html), [Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/) & [Ben Draut](https://github.com/drautb).

Beyond my life at the keyboard, I work in clay, watercolor, oil, colored pencil, pastel, digital media, letterpress, silk-screen, metal, silver, wood and garlic. I also like to spend a lot of time outside, soaking up sun or getting rained on.

I attended the Recurse Center in Summer 2016, and have nothing but nice things to say about RC. If you've been thinking about applying, [you should do it](https://www.recurse.com/)!

### Hello World

<p></p> I'm a software engineer broadly interested in computer systems. In the past I spent time thinking about security, programming langauges and machine learning.

I'm currently working on the compute platform team at Netflix.

Previously, I worked at [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com/) and [Galois](https://galois.com). At Marqeta I worked on credit card software, and at Galois I worked on [MATE](https://galois.com/project/mate/), a program analysis platform for helping developers find security vulnerabilities in their programs.

Before that I spent a few years in the computer science PhD program at the University Utah, where I was advised by [Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/), before dropping out with my masters. I designed and implemented [SweetPea](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01598-2), a programming language which addresses problems of correctness and replicability of pyschology experiments, in collaboration with [Matthew Flatt](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/), [Jonathan Cohen](https://webapps.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/JDC/Home_Page.html), [Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/) & [Ben Draut](https://github.com/drautb).

I like to make things. When I'm not making software, I like to make things in oil, clay, wood, watercolor, colored pencil, digital media, paper, letterpress, silk-screen, metal and garlic. I also like to spend a lot of time outside, soaking up sun or getting rained on.

I attended the Recurse Center in Summer 2016, and have nothing but nice things to say about RC. If you've been thinking about applying, [you should do it](https://www.recurse.com/)!

### Hello World

<p></p>

I'm a computer scientist broadly interested in systems, security and programming languages. I currently work as a software research engineer at [Galois](https://galois.com).

I graduated with my masters in Computer Science from the University Utah, where I was advised by [Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/). I designed and implemented SweetPea, a programming language which addresses problems of correctness and replicability of pyschology experiments, in collaboration with [Matthew Flatt](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/), [Jonathan Cohen](https://webapps.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/JDC/Home_Page.html), [Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/) & [Ben Draut](https://github.com/drautb).

Beyond my life at the keyboard, I work in clay, watercolor, oil, colored pencil, pastel, digital media, letterpress, silk-screen, metal, silver, wood and garlic. I also try to spend a lot of time outside, soaking up sun or getting rained on.

I attended the Recurse Center in Summer 2016, and have nothing but nice things to say about RC. If you've been thinking about applying, [you should do it](https://www.recurse.com/)!

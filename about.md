Hey there! I'm `annie`! At least, that's what my machine tells me.

I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, working with [Dr. Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/). I'm currently working on a domain specific language with [Dr. Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/), [Dr. Matthew Flatt](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/) & [Dr. Jonathon Cohen](https://webapps.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/JDC/Home_Page.html) that lets psychologists express constraints about their experiments, and solves these constraints. In the past I've also dabbled in research in [data visualization](https://github.com/Caleydo/lineage) with [Dr. Alex Lex](http://alexander-lex.net/), matrix analysis with [Dr. Charles Johnson](http://www.wm.edu/as/mathematics/faculty-directory/johnson_c.php), and astronomy with [Dr. Adam Bolton](http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bolton/Home.html).

I attended the Recurse Center in Summer 2016, and have nothing but nice things to say about RC. If you've been thinking about applying, [you should do it](https://www.recurse.com/)!

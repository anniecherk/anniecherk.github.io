### Hello World

<p></p>

I'm a computer scientist broadly interested in systems, security and programming languages. 

I recently graduated with my masters in Computer Science from the University Utah, where I was advised by [Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/). I designed and implemented SweetPea, a nascent programming language for experimental design, in collaboration with [Matthew Flatt](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/), [Jonathan Cohen](https://webapps.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/JDC/Home_Page.html), [Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/) & [Ben Draut](https://github.com/drautb).

I'll be joining [Galois](https://galois.com) in 2019.

I attended the Recurse Center in Summer 2016, and have nothing but nice things to say about RC. If you've been thinking about applying, [you should do it](https://www.recurse.com/)!

This is a survey of many different ways to think about numbers and how to count them, rooted in both Math and Computer Science.

Does thinking about numbers sound boring? Well hear me out, it'll be a wirlwind tour from Math History to Analysis to Number Theory to Architecture to Cryptography to Security to Distributed Systems to Information Theory-- there's something for everyone. We'll even use the word "Blockchain". Some highlights include:

* Numbers are glyphs
* Numbers are asymptotes of sequences
* Numbers are computations
* Numbers are lengths, and also a length of time of a computation
* Numbers are a set and some operators
* Numbers are bit-patterns

Apart from thinking about numbers in different ways being potentially interesting, it's also *useful* -- the topics below are solutions to fairly interesting problems which allow us to do everything from performing any computation at all, to using the internet, to letting you run my code on your machine, to being able to trust that code, to being able to verify identity and maintain privacy.

Here's the plan; below is the road map of everything we're going to touch on. For each topic, we're *not* going to go into detail (because, have you seen how long that list is??) but we'll look at the highlights and how they relate to the other topics. There's no reason to read it top-to-bottom and all the way through; flex those free will muscles and jump to whatever catches your fancy. 🔭😻

# Part 1: Counting Numbers

### Math: Numeral Systems
We're used to the [Hindu-Arabic representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system) of numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc),
and sometimes a positional numeral system like `IIIVXM`.

For more info, see: [Numeral Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system)
